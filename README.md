# Leetcode :terminal:

##### An anthology of my struggle to understand how on earth people practically implement these algorithms.

>>> 
This is a home for attempts at Leetcode problems in Go. I wouldn't recommend using these as an answer key.
I primarily use Leetcode problems as a way to get better at writing tests for weird edge cases.
But hey, trying out new algorithms is fun too.

    <pre>
These are by no means the absolute right answers, and many of them will likely be incomplete.
But they sure are a compilation of me giving it the ol' college try.
So if they help you, awesome! If not, sorry in advance on that one, friend.
